# Overview

## Project Name
Sample application for CNN model

## Description
This product shows sample guidance in starting to build a CNN machine learning model and applying the product into practice, thereby providing a strong foundation for upgrading ideas.


# Get Started

## Installation

### Python3 core

First go to the following link to install python core if your device is missing it:  
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Please make sure your python core is greater than version 3.0.0, otherwise the installation will have unexpected problems. In case your device has a python core lower than version 3.0.0, upgrade or uninstall it to reinstall the new version.


### IDE
Download the Vscode ide if you need to edit code or want to run the program through the ide at: https://code.visualstudio.com/download.
Make sure that after installing the ide, download the extensions python needed for you.

### Python Library
During the compilation process, make sure you have installed all the required libraries in the program. Below is a list of libraries used in the project:

1. mysql.connector: Library for connecting to MySQL databases. See more at: 

https://pypi.org/project/mysql-connector-python/

2. os: Library providing functions for interacting with the operating system. See more at: 

https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html

3. numpy: Python library for scientific computing and mathematics on arrays. See more at: 

https://numpy.org/

4. PIL: Python library for image processing. See more at: 

https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

5. tkinter: GUI (Graphical User Interface) library for Python. See more at: 

https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html

6. tensorflow: Open-source machine learning library by Google. See more at: 

https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/libraries-extensions

7. keras: Open-source neural network library that is easy to use. See more at:

https://keras.io/

8. io: Library providing tools for handling input/output streams (I/O). See more at: 

https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html

9. subprocess: Library for creating and managing subprocesses. See more at: 

https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html

10. psutil: Library providing functions for managing process and system information. See more at: 

https://pypi.org/project/psutil/

11. time: Library providing functions related to time. See more at: 

https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html

12. sys: Library providing variables and functions for interacting with the Python interpreter. See more at: 

https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html

In case you don't know how to install the python library, see the instructions on the following page: 

https://code.visualstudio.com/download.

### MYSQL Database
If you are working in windows environment, download xampp or any mysql workspace you know
https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html


## Clone the project
Clone the project at this link to your device: https://github.com/xzeo1123/PTPMMNM.git


## Download my data
Download Dataset from my drive at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UGthVB7tabjVgJpwEA4r9YtvpnVY4E5o/view?usp=sharing

Put that dataset folder in the project has same directory with all main folder
This dataset is template for data training this sample model. You can replace it with your own or some other datasets. Find more with this keyword "Dataset for training model tensorflow gender/emotion".

Do the same with trained model: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ngMKrF7DxW_5XOapVhmC5n_KdOHWOTRK/view?usp=drive_link

This forlder contains our trained model to make a quick predict app. You can replace these files with your new trained model.


## Run your application
### Re-training model
As suggested in the previous section, this test product I provide already has a trained model. However, you can still experimentally retrain the model as desired to get the value you expect. Things you need to know when you need retraining include:

Application theory including training parameter:

Some environments support hardware for you to train models with low computer conditions:

Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/

Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/

Make sure you have the right instruction to create account for using these environments.


### Using application

You can run your app to have an testing experience.
First, turn on your mysql connection host
Second, If you are using vscode ide, locate to file LoginUI.py in GUI folder and run it.

Or you are using terminal locate to GUI folder and run it with code: "python3 GUI/UILogin.py"

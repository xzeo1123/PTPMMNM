# Overview

## Project Name
Sample application for CNN model

## Description
This product shows sample guidance in starting to build a CNN machine learning model and applying the product into practice, thereby providing a strong foundation for upgrading ideas.


# Get Started

## Installation

### Python3 core

First go to the following link to install python core if your device is missing it:  
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Please make sure your python core is greater than version 3.0.0, otherwise the installation will have unexpected problems. In case your device has a python core lower than version 3.0.0, upgrade or uninstall it to reinstall the new version.


### IDE
Download the Vscode ide if you need to edit code or want to run the program through the ide at: https://code.visualstudio.com/download.
Make sure that after installing the ide, download the extensions python needed for you.

### Python Library
During the compilation process, make sure you have installed all the required libraries in the program. Below is a list of libraries used in the project:

1. mysql.connector: Library for connecting to MySQL databases. See more at:
